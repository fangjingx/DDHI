I leave out of consideration here the known difficulties related to the question of the correct characterization of the mode of existence of reason and its expressions . It has been very much discussed , especially in our school , whether conceptual knowledge has to be regarded psychologically as a faculty or as a continuous activity . These are difficulties and problems but not really objections ; they are objections only for the one who , again in the domain of psychology , intends to carry out the standpoint of a complete restriction to contents . Fries thought in this respect more vitally ; he did not want to be content with a theory of psychological phenomena , but aimed at a theory of the unit of life ; and I think we have reason to agree with him in this respect . What forms , however , a more substantial reason for the resistance against the Friesian claims is that on closer inspection one recognizes that one is thereby already necessarily pushed towards transcendental idealism . Because in the fact that conceptual knowledge makes itself felt in the form of a categorial requirement of an existential relation ( otherwise no more precisely determined ) to a world of existing , there lies already the division of truth . Both the contentual and the categorical form belong to knowledge as such . According to the position of naive realism we believe to find both united and to have in common perception complete knowledge before us . Closer inspection forces us in a well-known way to give up this position ; it becomes manifest to us that the experiential uniform perception consists of two distinct parts in regard to knowledge : the givenness of a contentual material and the existential reference to the unity of reality in which the former has to be integrated in a manner initially unknown .",,-1,,-1,,

The proof suffered , moreover , from imprecisions in its last part . Ackermann ’ s paper was received for publication on 30 March 1924 and came out on 26 November 1924 . In 1927 , received for publication on 29 July 1925 and published on 2 January 1927 , von Neumann criticized Ackermann ’ s proof and presented a consistency proof that followed lines somewhat different from those of Ackennann ’ s . The proof came to be accepted as establishing the consistency of a first-order arithmetic in which induction is applied only to quantifierfree formulas . When he was already acquainted with von Neumann ’ s proof , Ackermann communicated , in the form of a letter , a new consistency proof to Bernays . This proof developed and deepened the arguments used in Ackermann ’ s 1924 proof , and , like von Neumann ’ s , it applied to an arithmetic in which induction is restricted to quantifier-free formulas . It is with this proof of Ackermann ’ s that Hilbert ’ s remarks above [ BB : insert explicit reference ] ( pp . 477 -479 ) and Bernays ’ s present comments are concerned . It was felt at that point , among the members of the Hilbert school , that the consistency of full first-order arithmetic could be established by relatively straightforward extensions of the arguments used by von Neumann or by Ackermann ( vide [ ? ] , p . 137 , lines 20 -21 ; [ ? ] , p . 490 , line 4 u , to p . 491 , line 2 ; [ ? ] , p . 211 , lines 4 -7 ) . These hopes were dashed by Gödel ’ s 1931 . Ackermann ’ s unpublished proof was presented in [ ? ] , pp . 93 -130 . In [ ? ] Ackermann gave a consistency proof for full first-order arithmetic , using a principle of transfinite induction ( up to ε 0 ) that is not formalizable in this arithmetic .",,-1,,-1,,

And indeed it is the most elementary structural characteristics that are conveyed by cardinal numbers . Thus cardinal numbers play a role in all domains to which formal considerations are applicable ; in particular we encounter cardinal number within theoretical logic in a wide variety of ways : for example , as cardinal number of the subjects of a predicate ( or as one says , as cardinal number of the arguments of a logical function ); as cardinal number of the variable predicates involved in a logical sentence ; as cardinal number of the applications of a logical operation involved in the construciton of a concept or sentence ; as cardinal number of the sentences involved in a mode of inference ; as the type-number of a logical expression , i . e . the highest number of successive subject-predicate relations involved in the expression ( in the sense of the ascent from the objects of a theory to the predicates , from the predicates to the predicates of the predicates , from these latter to their predicates , and so on ) .",,-1,,-1,,

Set theory offers the classic example for such an occurrence , in particular the paradox of the set of all sets that goes as far back as to Cantor himself . This paradox is so serious that such very distinguished mathematicians as Kronecker and Poincare for instance felt induced to deny set theory in entirety — one of the most fruitful and powerful branches of mathematics in general — any justification of existence .",,-1,,-1,,
