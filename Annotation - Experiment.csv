RQ1: Is the notion of formality in Hilbert’s programme the conceptual opposite of content?,1,"The typically mathematical character of the theory of provability reveals itself especially clearly , through the role of the logical symbolism . The symbolism is here the means for carrying out the formal abstraction . The transition from the point of view of logical content to the formal one takes place when one ignores the original meaning of the logical symbols and makes the symbols themselves representatives of formal objects and connections.",Scored 1 because: states the relation between form and content involves ignoring the meaning of symbols.,FX,1,"Mentions the transition from content to form, importantly illuminates that the meaning of symbols is irrelevant for forms.",GS,1,"I am honestly unsure here whether to score 1 or 0. Intuitively, this seems to be a relevant unit. However, I feel like, to be sure about it, some prior knowledge about the author is needed.",NV,1,
,1,"Hilbert takes over what is positively fruitful from each of the two attempts at grounding mathematics discussed above. From the logical theory he takes the method of the rigorous formalization of inference. That this formalization is necessary follows directly from the way the task is formulated. For the mathematical proofs are to be made the object of a concrete-intuitive form of view. To this end, however, it is necessary that they are projected, as it were, into the domain of the formal. Accordingly , in Hilbert' s theory we have to distinguish sharply between the formal image of the arithmetical statements and proofs as the object of the theory, on the one hand, and the contentual thought about this formalism, as the content of the theory, on the other hand. The formalization is done in such a way that formulas take the place of contentual mathematical statements, and that a sequence of formulas, following each other according to certain rules, takes the place of an inference. But one does not attach any meaning to the formulas; the formula does not count as the expression of a thought, but it corresponds to a contentual judgment only insofar as it plays, within the formalism, a role analogous to that which the judgment plays within the contentual consideration.",Scored 1 because: states a contrast between form and content.,,1,Clearly distinguishes form from contentual thought.,,1,,,1,
,0,"Meanwhile, this completion still demands new and various works. By closer examination we presently discern that the consistency question of integers and sets is not isolated for itself; rather, it belongs to a great region of the most difficult epistemological questions of specific mathematical coloration. To characterize briefly this region of questions, I mention by name the problem of principal solvability of every mathematical question, the problem of supplementary controllability of the results of a mathematical investigation, the question of a criterion for the simplicity of mathematical proofs, the question of relations between contentualness (Inhaltlichkeit) and formalism in mathematics and logic, and finally the problem of decidability of a mathematical question by a finite number of operations.","Scored 0 because: mentions contentualness and formalism without specifying the relation between them. 
(To check: the specific relation Hilbert has in mind)",,0,"States that there’s a relation between the two, but the relation itself remains unknown.",,-1,No reference to any form of contrast between concepts.,,-1,
,0,"By completely ignoring the truth of the axioms of an axiom system, the content of the basic concepts also becomes irrelevant, and thus one is lead to completely abstract from all intuitive content of the theory. This abstraction is further supported by a second feature, which comes as an addition to the newer axiomatics, as it was developed above all in Hilbert’ s Foundations of Geometry, and which is, in general, essential for the formation of recent mathematics, namely, the existential conception of the theory.","Scored 0 because: states that axioms require abstraction from content. 
(To check: if axioms are exemplars of the formal)",,0,This passage mentions that content is irrelevant in an axiomatic system. but it remains to be supported by another passage that the axiomatic system is related to the formality as such.,,0,,,0,
,0,"It is a characteristic of this more rigorous form of axiomatics that results through both abstraction from the subject matter and the existential form — we want to call it “ formal axiomatics ” for short—that it requires a proof of consistency, while contentual axiomatics introduces its fundamental concepts by reference to known facts of experience and presents its basic principles either as obvious facts, which one can make clear to oneself, or as extracts from complexes of experiences, thereby expressing the belief that one is on the track of laws of nature and at the same time intending to support this belief through the success of the theory.","Scored 0 because: mentions ""abstraction from subject matter"", but compatible with both formal-as-topic-neutral or contentless. (To check: further evidence for one of the reading)",,0,"It mentions abstraction from ""subject matter"": but this invites a reading between ""formal-as-topic-neutral"" and ""formal-as-contentless""",,0,"To assess passages like this one, it would be helpful to have a list of appropriate synonyms for the concepts used in the research questions.",,1,
,-1,"However, when he speaks of a meaning of the number signs, Mr. Aloys Müller is apparently not at all thinking of the kind of meaning as it occurs in the words of a language. Rather he is thinking of the meaning that befits the number signs within the formalism of number theory. But senseless figures are equally capable of such meaning, because of the external properties that are found in them and of the external relationships that can be observed between them.","Scored -1 because: ""formalism"" means the system of number theory, irrelevant to the concept of formality.",,-1,Here the formalism of number theory just means the axiomatic system of number theory.,,-1,,,-1,
,-1,"The first extension consists in introducing a formal expression for “x is the same object as y,” or “an object different from y.” For this purpose the “identity of x and y” has to be formally represented as a particular relation, the properties of which are to be formulated as axioms.",Scored -1 because: irrelevant to the concept of formality,,-1,it just mentions formal expression without saying anything relevant to the notion of formality.,,-1,,,0,"I picked 0 cause if you follow the guidelines very strictly, it talks about form. If you take the guidelines less literally, I would consider it -1"

RQ2: Is formality distinguished from generality?,1,"Mathematics and logic are based on two different directions of abstraction. While logic deals with the contentually most general, ( pure ) mathematics is the general theory of the formal relations and properties. Such that, on the one hand each mathematical consideration is subject to the logical laws, while, on the other hand each logical figure-of-thought falls into the domain of mathematical consideration because of the external structure that necessarily comes with it.","Scored 1 because: 
1. respects Kant's claim ""logic is general"" (contentually most general)
2. states a difference between formality and generality.",,1,This illustrates that logic is general in Kant’s sense: it governs the general form of thought.,,1,,,1,
,0,"In his Zurich lecture on “ Axiomatic Thought ” (1917), Hilbert gave a summary of the leading methodological thoughts and an overview of the results of research in axiomatics. Here he characterizes the axiomatic method as a general procedure for scientific thinking. In all areas of knowledge, in which one has already come to the point of setting up a theory, or, as Hilbert says, to an arrangement of the facts by means of a framework of concepts, this procedure sets in. Then, it always becomes obvious that a few propositions suffice for the logical construction of the theory, and through this the axiomatic foundation of the theory is made possible. This will at first take place in the sense of the old axiomatics. However, one can always—as within geometry—move on to Hilbert’ s axiomatic standpoint by disregarding the epistemic character of the axioms and by considering the whole framework of concepts only (as a possible form of a system of interconnected relationships) in regard to its internal structure.","Scored 0 because: mentions ""general [...] thinking"", unsure if it aligns with Kant's notion.
(To check: if ""generality"" aligns with Kant)",,0,"The passage contains ""general procedure for scientific thinking"", but it remains to be seen what's the relation betwen scientific thinking and thinking as such.",,-1,,,-1,
,-1,"If one has a general procedure for eliminating, from a proof with a certain concretely describable property E, the ﬁrst occurrence of the sign Z, without the proof losing the property E in the process, then one can, by repeated application of the procedure, completely remove the sign Z from such a proof, without its losing the property E.",Scored -1 because: irrelevant to the concept of generality.,,-1,"Here Bernays is describing an algorithm using the name of ""general procedure"", which has nothing to do with generality of thought.",,-1,It seems to many relevant information are lacking in order to score a higher point.,,0,I feel like this unit lacks too much context to judge whether it is -1 or 0. It could help if it'd be made clearer in the guidelines what is meant with extra information
